<p>In previous speeches, the president, however, said the Mangyans&nbsp;<strong>&mdash; </strong>the indigenous people of Mindoro&nbsp;<strong>&mdash;</strong>&nbsp;as the beneficiaries of Boracay.</p>

<p>The original inhabitants of Boracay are actually the Ati people, some of whom live in the aptly named Ati Village in Barangay Manoc-Manoc.</p>

<p>Environment OIC Undersecretary Maria Paz Luna last April said Proclamation 1064, which reclassifies land on the island, awarded the Atis 2.1 hectares of land there.</p>

<p>She added that of the 600 hectares of land on Boracay, about 300 hectares have&nbsp;already been titled. The titles on those are still being verified.</p>

<p>Luna said the IPs of Boracay <a href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/04/12/1805307/no-place-table-yet-atis-boracay-denr-official-admits">built a village there and were granted Certificate of Ancestral Domain titles.</a> This is in accordance with Republic Act No. 8371, The Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Rights Act Of 1997.</p>
