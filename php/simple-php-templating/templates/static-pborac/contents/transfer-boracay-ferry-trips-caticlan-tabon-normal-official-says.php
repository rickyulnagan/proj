		"body" => '<p>AKLAN, Philippines &mdash; An official of the Municipal Government of Kalibo, Aklan on Monday said the transfer of Boracay ferry trips from Caticlan Jetty Port to Tabon port is just a normal occurrence.</p>

<p>Jimmy Maming, head of the municipal economic department of Kalibo, made the explanation when asked by <strong>Philstar.com</strong> about the sudden rerouting of boat trips to Tabon port following a capsizing incident.</p>

<p>A motorboat last Saturday night capsized near the Cagban Port on Boracay reportedly prompting the Philippine Coast Guard to transfer the trips to Tabon.</p>

<p>Strong winds and waves reportedly caused the accident that destroyed the boat. No one was injured from the incident.</p>

<p>Maming explained that Malay town has two jetty ports namely the Caticlan Jetty port which is run by the provincial government and Tabon Port which is run by the local government.</p>

<p>The Malay municipal official also clarified that transfer of trips happen annually especially during the southwest monsoon or habagat season when waves are stronger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is automatic,&rdquo; Maming told <strong>Philstar.com </strong>in Filipino while referring to the transfer of ferry trips to Tabon port.</p>

<p>This rerouting of trips happens from June to October yearly, according to Maming.</p>

<p>A police manning Tabon port, who refused to be named, said that since the trips were transferred in the current port on Sunday afternoon, around 500 passengers already traveled.</p>

<p>Boat rides from Tabon port to Boracay island costs P25 per way.</p>

<p>All residents and workers who wish to enter Boracay are being verified by the municipal officials and undergo security checks after President Rodrigo Duterte prohibited tourists from visiting the island.</p>

<p>Boracay has been closed to tourists since April 26 to pave way for its rehabilitation.</p>
