<p>Boracay Island Water Company, Inc. (Boracay Water) spent the first month of the island&#39;s closure to tourists replacing its old pipes&nbsp;to comply with &quot;water quality or water that is fit for recreational activities and contact uses that would not pollute the island&rsquo;s pristine beach waters.&quot;</p>

<p>Anthony Piodina, a utility worker for subcontractor&nbsp;Tri-Point Builders, told <strong>Philstar.com</strong>, that the replacement of the pipes is nearly done.</p>

<p>&quot;This is to change the old [pipes]. We will change it with new ones so that the water will be clean,&quot; Piodina said in an interview.</p>

<p>Tri-point sent workers all the way from Sta. Rosa, Laguna&nbsp; for the project.</p>

<h2><strong>&#39;Conforming to discharge standards of DENR&nbsp;a priority&#39;</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, in a statement sent to <strong>Philstar.com</strong>, Boracay Water said &ldquo;it continues to remain compliant with the stringent pollution control standards of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Boracay Water&nbsp;recently completed a diversion system from the Balabag Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) to the Manoc-Manoc STP. This is to allow the system to handle more sewer connections even from non-Boracay Water customers.</p>

<p>Boracay Water, which started in operations in 2010, claimed that is the only water service provider with a centralized sewerage system in Boracay. It added that its island sewer system is aligned with the masterplan of its regulator, the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority.</p>

<p>The water service provider also operates and manages the Balabag STP.</p>

<p>It is set to build a&nbsp;third STP with a treatment capacity of five million liters a&nbsp;day in Barangay Yapak.</p>

<p>The project is eyed to be completed in 2020 &ldquo;to cater to the wastewater treatment requirements of commercial and residential establishments in the island&rsquo;s third barangay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will make Boracay island the only beach destination with a sewage treatment in each of its barangays,&rdquo; Boracay Water said.</p>

<p>The water service provider vowed to ensure that wastewater from its customers will conform with DENR standards.</p>

<p>Last March, Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu said sewage is one of the top problems on&nbsp;Boracay. He urged local officials to implement an ordinance requiring residents and businesses to connect to the sewerage system.</p>

<p>The environment chief cited the Malay municipal council passed an ordinance in 2012 requiring residents and businesses within 61 meters of&nbsp;sewerage pipes to connect to the system.</p>

<p>Establishments and residents far from the designated distance, on the other hand, were asked to maintain&nbsp;STPs and septic tanks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are giving companies not connected to the sewer lines one month to link up. If they fail...they will face sanctions,&rdquo; Cimatu was quoted by The&nbsp;STAR as saying last March.</p>

'.videobox('//www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x6lvah3?autoPlay=1').'

<p>The STAR reported that Boracay Water said that only 198 of the 578 business establishments have yet to&nbsp;connect&nbsp;to sewer lines while only five percent of its 4,331 residential customers are connected to the sewers.<strong>&nbsp;&mdash;With reports from The STAR/Rhodina Villanueva</strong></p>
